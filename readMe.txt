RE: 	New location for my Mfiles: 
	\\R2d2\C\USER\robotLab\patton_shares_MFILES


With the death of MANIP, I need a new way to share my MATLAB M-file utilities  for processing data, etc. For those of you who type "jim" when you start matlab so that you can process data, you must now do the following: 

   1. 	Run matlab.
   2. 	Type "which jim" to see where you copy of jim.m is located. 
   3. 	go to 	
		\\R2d2\C\USER\robotLab\patton_shares_MFILES
	and copy the new version of jim.m to your local computer,
	replacing the old one.  

Additional things to NOTE:

if you cannot get to this site on R2D2, it is probably because you do not have permissions (although you should all already have permissions to reach the parent directory, roboticsLab) If so, see me or Santiago.

You no longer need to also type "go" to run the go.m program. It is now folded into jim.m. 

You may want to make your own copy of these (so you can use them on your laptop when you are not networked), but I will periodically update these with bug fixes, etc. You can check lastUpdated.log. 

These instructions will be located in readMe.rtf

Save a copy of this. Let me know of any problems.
